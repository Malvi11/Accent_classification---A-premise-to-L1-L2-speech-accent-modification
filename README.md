# Accent_classification---A-premise-to-L1-L2-speech-accent-modification
I developed this project by using Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP.

# Problem Statement: 
Non-native speakers are frequently facing problems with automated assistants and speech which are getting from devices that are not typical in normal pronunciation.

# Solution:
Step 1: User speech
Step 2: Classify accent
Step 3: If it is native directly pass it to the automated device 
Step 4: If it is non-native 
Step 5: Convert into a native English accent
Step 6: Pass to the automated device
